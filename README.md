# Rock-Paper-Scissors

For this project, we will create the game Rock Paper Scissors. This game will be played entirely in the console.

It’s best practice to link to an external JavaScript file inside this script tag. 

Using an external JavaScript file keeps your HTML file clean and organized.

You don’t have to write additional code in the HTML file. This game is played entirely via the console.

Your game will be played against the computer. You will write a function that randomly returns “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”.

Your game will be played by a human player. You will write a function that takes the user choice and returns it.

Your game will keep track of the players score. You will write variables to keep track of the players score.

Your game will be played round by round. 

You will write a function that takes the human and computer player choices as arguments, plays a single round, 
increments the round winner’s score and logs a winner announcement.

Your game will play 5 rounds. 

When making interactive projects, like this one, you might be tempted to add more features, 
improve interactivity, user experience, design and styling of your website, and so on.

We recommend not doing that, and saving this effort for your portfolio projects.
